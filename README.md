# Android 101

Welcome! This repository is the home for all of the code written in the Android 101 series of meetups that the [Cleveland Android Group](http://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-Android-Group/) is organizing.  
Each directory within this repository with coincide with one of the projects we'll be working on while following along in the [Big Nerd Ranch's (BNR) Android Programming Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/android-programming/). 
While the projects should follow closely to the BNR guide, we'll be making minor modifications to cover some new things in Android as well as some topics that aren't covered in the book (like [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)).

If you have any questions about anything in here, or about something taken from one of the meetups, please post these as a [Github Issue](https://github.com/Cleveland-Android-Group/android-101-workshops/issues) (ideally labelled 'Question') so we can
answer them there, and so others can comment and we can all benefit ;) Please remember our philosophy here: We DON'T BELIEVE IN EXPERTS! We ALL have something to learn so ask any question and respond with the utmost courtesy, empathy, and open-mindedness, or in other words - don't be timid. We're all here to learn!
