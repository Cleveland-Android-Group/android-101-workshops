# Android 101

Welcome! This repository is the home for all of the code written in the Android 101 series of meetups that the [Cleveland Android Group](http://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-Android-Group/) is organizing. 

Each directory within this repository will coincide with one of the projects we'll be working on while following along in the [Big Nerd Ranch's Android Programming Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/android-programming/).  

While the projects should follow closely along with the BNR guide, we will be making minor modifications to cover some new things in Android as well as some topics that aren't covered in the book (like [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)).

If you have any questions about anything here, or about something taken from one of the meetups, please post these as a [Github Issue](https://github.com/Cleveland-Android-Group/android-101-workshops/issues) (ideally labelled 'Question') so we can answer them there and so others can comment and we can all benefit ;)  

Please remember our philosophy: **We DON'T BELIEVE IN EXPERTS!** We ALL have something to learn so ask any question and respond to all questions with the utmost courtesy, empathy, and open-mindedness, or in other words - **Don't be timid or shy. We're all here to learn!**

If you'd like to be added as a member to this Github group (and I hope that you will!), please just open a [Github issue](https://github.com/Cleveland-Android-Group/android-101-workshops/issues) requesting to be added, [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/DaveShah), or message me through the [meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-Android-Group/) so that I can add you.  

Thanks!
